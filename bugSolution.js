This solution addresses the issue by ensuring the third-party library interacts with the native UI only after the component mounts and before it unmounts.  It also includes improved error handling.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import MyThirdPartyLib from 'my-third-party-lib'; // Assume this library has async operations

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    libInitialized: false,
    error: null
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    try {
      this.myLibInstance = new MyThirdPartyLib();
      await this.myLibInstance.initialize(); // Assume an async initialization method
      this.setState({ libInitialized: true });
    } catch (error) {
      this.setState({ error });
    }
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.myLibInstance) {
      this.myLibInstance.destroy();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { libInitialized, error } = this.state;
    if (error) {
      return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;
    }
    if (!libInitialized) {
      return <Text>Initializing...</Text>;
    }
    return (
      <View>
        <MyThirdPartyLib ref={instance => this.myLibInstance = instance} />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

Note:  Replace `'my-third-party-lib'` and `MyThirdPartyLib` with your actual library and its import statement.  Adjust the `initialize()` and `destroy()` methods to match the API of the specific third-party library you're using.
