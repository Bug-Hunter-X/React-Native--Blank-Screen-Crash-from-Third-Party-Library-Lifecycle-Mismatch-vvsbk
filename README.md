# React Native Blank Screen/Crash Due to Third-Party Library Lifecycle Issues

This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug where integrating a third-party library incorrectly leads to blank screens or crashes. The issue arises from improper handling of the library within the React Native component lifecycle.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows a component that uses a hypothetical third-party library (`MyThirdPartyLib`).  If this library tries to access or modify the native UI before the component mounts or after it unmounts, it can cause the app to crash or display a blank screen.  The exact error message will vary depending on the library and the nature of the interaction. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.  It demonstrates better integration by ensuring the library's initialization and cleanup occur safely within the `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods, respectively.  Proper error handling and asynchronous operations are incorporated to prevent race conditions and ensure that the library interacts with the native UI only when appropriate.  This robust approach minimizes the risk of crashes and unexpected behavior.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. `npm install`
3. Run the app (instructions may vary based on your setup). You'll likely see an error or a blank screen initially. 
4. Then test the bugSolution.js
